In a large pot, place the parsley and dill. Arrange the celery leaves on top, then the chicken, and then the other vegetables. Spread the chopped garlic on top and add salt and pepper if you like. Pour the bottles of water on top and bring it to a boil. Let it simmer for about 1.5 hours. Just before serving, add the lemon juice to the soup. \n2.

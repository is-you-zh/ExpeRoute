This requires calculating the asset's remaining-useful-life (RUL) based on the current and historic usage patterns and building a mathematical model that is capable of extrapolating failures from the past to the future.\r\n\r\nThe Predictive Maintenance API offers:\r\n  -  failure rate estimation based on real-time operating conditions\r\n  -  failure rate estimation based on historic failure patterns\r\n\r\nThe *Real-time Failure Rate API* allows you to calculate the failure rate of various components, such as Accumulators, Actuators, Belts, Clutches, Brakes etc. in real-time based on the prevailing operating conditions of the assets. This helps you in estimating the RUL for various assets such as:\r\n  -  vehicles in motion, based on the sensors attached to the vehicles to various key parts\r\n  -  stationary machinery in manufacturing plants \r\n  -  individual components inside machines etc.\r\n\r\nWhen you do not have the previous failure records or maintenance records available, or if your machinery is brand new with provisions to capture the required data using sensors, this API is the best option for high accuracy predictions.\r\n\r\nThe *Historic Failure Rate API* allows you estimate the asset failure risks for a population of assets based on the maintenance records and previous failure patterns. This helps when you do not have provision to attach sensors and have adequate history of maintenance records for a population of machinery.\r\n\r\n[Get in touch](http://Cenacle.website/#contact) with us if you are interested in utilizing our Predictive Maintenance API in your applications.",

DASH leverages standard HTTP protocol and can be easily deployed on existing Internet infrastructure (web servers, CDNs, firewalls, etc). \r\n\r\nCommon Encryption (CENC) \r\nCENC is an industry standards based approach to content encryption. CENC identifies standard encryption and key mapping mechanisms that may be utilized by one or more DRM systems to allow the decryption of the same file using different DRM systems. CENC enables content providers to encrypt their content once and deliver it to numerous client devices and their assorted DRM schemes. \r\n\r\nEncrypted Media Extensions (EME) \r\nEME is a proposed W3C standard that provides a set of common APIs that can be used to interact with DRM systems and manage license key exchange. EME allows content providers to design a single application solution for all devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey benefits of Widevine's DRM solution:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport for reliable content protection across multiple systems:. \r\nProvides ubiquitous device coverage and extends synergy across multiple content protection systems. See a list of currently supported platforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComplete control and flexibility during video playback:\r\nFully featured HTML5 video player with adaptive streaming, QoS, and accessibility support across devices.",

I.e. as if the photo was taken with respect to any desired angle relative to the camera.  This is typically used when the facial photo is captured off angle and a zero-corrected fully frontal image (0 degrees pitch, yaw, and roll) is required.\r\n\r\nDetected facial features may be corrected or modified to improve the final results of subsequent steps. For example, an eye in the picture may be hidden or obscured; requesting just eye feature points, manually correcting their locations, and feeding this data into a more detailed request will help improve the accuracy of additional feature point and pose detection.",

Payments are sent through AFEX’s intermediary banks, payment channels and are bound by applicable laws, regulations, clearing house rules or payment processing procedures.\r\n\r\nOur API is built by developers for developers making it straightforward to integrate with our systems.\r\n\r\nWe’ve also designed our documentation to be easy to use. Our API calls are grouped into feature sets which you can see in the navigation here in our API documentation.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in this version?\r\n------------\r\nThe latest release to support these changes was deployed to production on 28th of June, 2019.\r\n\r\n* A new *Production* API endpoint `https://webapi.afex.com/` was deployed with new load-balanced architecture for **increased stability** and **up-time**\r\n\r\n* New V2 launch of key methods including [api/V2/Quote](https://doc.api.afex.com/?version=latest#98c6fc20-a17a-4d42-b141-93c4f16c77bd), [api/V2/Trades/Create](https://doc.api.afex.com/?version=latest#91dda474-6ac2-435c-8999-e2f9302130c6), and [api/V2Payments/Create](https://doc.api.afex.com/?version=latest#9a8d48e2-012e-4f05-8f43-bb238cf705da) *Note that methods listed as \"V2\" are available through the Version 2 endpoint*\r\n\r\n* Enhanced beneficiary validation for **IBAN** and **SWIFTBIC/Routing Code**\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Notes\r\n------------\r\n**Non-Prod:** V5.2019 was be deployed to the demo environment on the 6th of June, 2019.\r\n\r\n**TLS version support:** Effective June 2018, AFEX no longer supports TLS version 1.0. AFEX currently supports TLS 1.1 and 1.2 in both the demo and production environments.\r\n\r\n**Production server IP address range:** Effective August 2018, the AFEX production servers public IP range was changed to `136.179.35.192/26`.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n------------\r\n**1. Read the documentation**\r\nWe recommend that you read the API documentation in Developer Center to familiarize yourself with the API conventions and functionality along with exploring the examples.\r\n\r\n**2. Use the Demo API**\r\nThe Demo API is connected to our test infrastructure. It returns real data but executes trades on your *demo account* and does not execute live transactions.\r\n    \r\nA unique demo account will be provided to you as part of your engagement and will mirror the configuration needed for your *eventual* production account.\r\n\r\nDemo end points are:\r\n\r\n**AFEX API (beneficiaries, trading and payments):**\r\n\r\n    Version 1.0 https://demo.api.afex.com:7890/\r\n    \r\n    Version 2.0 https://WebApiDemo.afex.com/\r\n\r\n**Partner API (account on-boarding):** \r\n\r\n    Version 1.0** https://demo.api.afex.com:7885/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**3.

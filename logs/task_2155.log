Criteria:
- If any part of the historical experience (scene, subtask intents) **matches the type of task or information** in the current query, answer "yes".
- If the tools used in the historical experience could be reused or adapted to solve (part of) the current query, answer "yes".
- Otherwise, answer "no".

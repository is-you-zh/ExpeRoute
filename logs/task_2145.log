Criteria:
- If any part of the historical experience (scene, subtask intents) **matches the type of task or information** in the current query, answer "yes".
- If the tools used in the historical experience could be reused or adapted to solve (part of) the current query, answer "yes".
- Otherwise, answer "no".

[2025-08-01 22:21:52][INFO][MainThread][Thought: To proceed with this request, I need to complete two tasks: 
1. Validate the phone numbers connected to the Maytapi account (assuming it's possible through the provided tools).
2. Fetch the holiday dates in the US for this year using the holidays API.

First, I'll use the "v1_holidays_for_holidays_by_api_ninjas" API to fetch the holiday dates in the US for this year 2023.]

[2025-08-01 22:22:03][INFO][MainThread][Thought: I have fetched the holiday dates in the US for this year 2023. The fetched holidays include:

1. New Year's Day: January 1, 2023 (Sunday) - Federal Holiday
2. Day off for New Year's Day: January 2, 2023 (Monday) - Federal Holiday
3. Thanksgiving Day: November 23, 2023 (Thursday) - Federal Holiday

Next, I will address the request to validate the phone numbers connected to the Maytapi account. However, please note that there seems to be a misunderstanding with the available tools. We can verify phone numbers but I can't confirm that any phone number is connected specifically to a Maytapi account using the available functions.

I will now conclude the task as I was able to provide information on US holidays but unable to address the Maytapi account related query. Please let me know if you have any specific phone numbers you would like to verify.]

[2025-08-01 19:05:17][INFO][MainThread][Judge usability prompt: 
You are an intelligent task scheduling assessment expert. 
Your job is to determine whether a historical experience could help solve a new user query.

Current user query:
I'm hosting a game night and need some trivia questions along with a random charades word of medium difficulty. Can you help me gather those?
Historical experience:
{'experience_id': 'a901958a-320c-4e1c-b1b1-167b69ee1399', 'task_scene': 'Game night preparation', 'score': 0.9159, 'subtask_intents': ['Gather trivia questions', 'Get random charades word'], 'execution_type': 'sequential', 'merge_logic': 'merge', 'execution_strategy': ["User Query: I'm hosting a game night and need some trivia questions along with a random charades word of medium difficulty.

Please answer only "yes" or "no" (lowercase):

Criteria:
- If any part of the historical experience (scene, subtask intents) **matches the type of task or information** in the current query, answer "yes".
- If the tools used in the historical experience could be reused or adapted to solve (part of) the current query, answer "yes".
- Otherwise, answer "no".

[2025-08-01 19:05:57][INFO][MainThread][Thought: It seems that there was a misunderstanding or an error in retrieving a medium-difficulty charades word from the API. The response lacks the specific details needed for a charades word, and instead, it provides a generic description about the API's behavior with 'Medium' difficulty.

Given this issue, I will proceed to finish up the task providing the trivia question and apologize for the inability to fetch a proper medium-difficulty charades word. Let's finalize the response.]
